# Contributing to [Privacy Brigade]
Thank you for your interest to contribute to the Privacy Brigade campaign! :tada:

## Getting Started
With Privacy Brigade being a Mozilla Community orientated campaign please get [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox) and also read up about [tracking](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/teach/smarton/tracking/).

### Writing a talk
Pick a favourite online activity of yours and put together a talk about the role you can play, through it, within the context of privacy; and what it means to you.
Invite your friends, family, teachers and collegues to attend!

If you dont know how to get started then you can take a look at [this post](https://pranjalvyas.wordpress.com/2017/04/17/privacy-brigade-gp-gandhinagar/) for ideas on how to talk about privacy.

### Developing
